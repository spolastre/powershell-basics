Learning Powershell 

Welcome to my personal PowerShell Learning Repository! This repository is designed to help me learn and improve myPowerShell scripting skills.

## Getting Started

I am currently using: 

- Learn Windows Powershell in a Month of Lunches book - Tip is to get it from Manning.com and not Amazon.  Much better deals. 
 I got the latest version, the previous version, and physical book for $36
- ACloudGuru
- Udemy for Business
